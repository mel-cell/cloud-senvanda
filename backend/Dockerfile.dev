# Install basic tools and Air for hot reload
# Using a specific older version of Air that supports Go 1.24 or just go install without version constraint if compatible,
# but the error said Air required Go 1.25. Let's try @v1.61.0 which should be safer or just latest but we need to upgrade base image if possible.
# Wait, Go 1.24 is very new? actually likely user has older Go but image is 1.24.
# The error "requires go >= 1.25" suggests we are using a very bleeding edge Air or the base image is slightly behind what Air expects.
# Let's downgrade Air slightly to be safe.
